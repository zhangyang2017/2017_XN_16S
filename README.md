# Treatment of Diet-Induced Obese Mice with Xanthohumol and its Non-Estrogenic Derivatives DXN and TXN Modulates Composition of the Fecal Microbiota, Bile Acids and is Associated with Improvement of Metabolic Syndrome Biomarkers

Xanthohumol (XN), a prenylated flavonoid found in hops, reduces weight gain and improves dysfunctional glucose 
and lipid metabolism in preclinical animal models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). 
Gut microbes can metabolize XN into a potent phytoestrogen, 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN). To address concerns 
with phytoestrogen exposure, in a previous study we tested two hydrogenated XN derivatives, α, β -dihydro-XN 
(DXN) and tetrahydro-XN (TXN), that cannot be metabolically converted into 8-PN. We fed C57BL/6J mice a 
high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing XN, DXN or TXN for 13 weeks with a submaximal dose (for XN) of 30 
mg/kg/day to compare differences in pharmacological response among the three compounds. All three compounds 
improved impaired glucose tolerance in mice compared to the HFD control; however, only the derivatives 
significantly decreased HOMA-IR and leptin. Furthermore, only TXN reduced body mass gain and fasting plasma 
glucose levels. Both DXN and TXN increased oxygen consumption via mild mitochondrial uncoupling, but they did 
not activate liver AMPK and suppressed it in muscle; therefore, the mechanism(s) by which these derivatives 
confer their benefits remains unclear. We hypothesized that XN and its hydrogenated derivatives mediate their 
beneficial effects by improving barrier function of the gut, thus reducing inflammation, and modulating 
composition of the gut microbiota. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the 16S rRNA genes of fecal samples 
from each animal, measured gene expression for genes that affect the epithelial barrier, inflammation and bile 
acid metabolism, and determined bile acid composition of the feces. We observed a significant association in 
the structure and membership of the microbiota with treatment. The compounds significantly decreased the 
percentages of Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes. Specifically, TXN treatment significantly changed bile acid 
composition and decreased inflammation induced by the HFD in white adipose tissue and the colon. Moreover, 
transkingdom network analysis revealed potential bacteria modulators Marvinbryantia, Romboutsia and other 
undefined genera from the Lachnospiraceae family in the interaction with host energy and bile acid metabolism. 
We postulate that TXN treatment ameliorates DIO and the concomitant symptoms of MetS by changing the 
composition of the gut microbiota, bile acid metabolism and host energy metabolism. Further study on the 
mechanism of action of the TXN-selected microbiota on ameliorating symptoms of MetS in DIO using a germ-free 
mouse model is needed.
